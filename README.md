API stands for "Application program interface." It is used to transfer data from one application to another. 

What is "JSON"? Why do developers use this?

JSON stands for "JavaScript Object Notation." 
It is a way to store information in an organized, easy-to-access manner.

It is easy for machines to parse and generate and it is easy for humans to read and write.

What does data.birds[1].members[2] do?
